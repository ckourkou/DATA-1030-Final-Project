# Predicting Draft Round for College Football Players
This project uses data from Stathead to predict which round in the NFL draft college football players were selected in, or if they went undrafted. 
The data contains key metrics for passing, rushing, and receiving, as well as games played, years played, and team.
Four ML classification models (XGBoost, Random Forest, Support Vector Classifier, KNN Classifier) are fit and evaluated by accuracy.
